# School Management System in C

## Overview
The **School Management System** is a console-based application written in C. It allows users to manage the essential operations of a school, including student management, teacher management, attendance tracking, exam results, and fee management.

This project demonstrates the use of **data structures**, **file handling**, and **modular programming** in C. It also provides a user-friendly interface via a menu-driven system.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code)

### Steps to Run:
1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-system.git

 
 
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
3. **Compile the code**:
4. **Run the executable**:



### Note:
All data will be stored in text files (e.g., `students.txt`, `teachers.txt`, etc.) for persistence across sessions.

---

## File Handling
Each module stores data using text files to ensure that records are saved even when the application is closed.

For example:
- Student details are stored in `students.txt`
- Teacher details in `teachers.txt`
- Attendance records in `attendance.txt`

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication (admin login) to secure the system.
- Add more advanced reporting features (e.g., generate a full student report including attendance and exam performance).
- Include data backup and restore functionality.
